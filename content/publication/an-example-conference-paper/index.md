abstract: Soft biological tissues and muscles composed of the semiflexible
  networks exhibit rapid strain-hardening behaviors to protect them from
  accidental rupture. In contrast, synthetic soft elastomers, usually featured
  with flexible networks, lack such behaviors, leading to a notorious issue when
  applying to a promising artificial muscle technology (dielectric elastomer,
  DE), that is electromechanical instability (EMI) induced premature breakdown.
  We report that a facile thermomechanical training method can adaptively
  reconstruct the network of a soft triblock copolymer elastomer to transform
  its flexible network strands into semiflexible ones without extra chemical
  modifications and additives, so that the electro-actuation performance is
  significantly enhanced by avoiding EMI. The free-standing actuators of trained
  elastomers exhibit a large stable electro-actuation strain and a high
  theoretical energy density (133%, 307 kJ m-3 at 158.1 V μm-1), and the
  capacity of actuating at low-temperature environments (-15 ℃).
